SpoonFed is a place to not only get inspiration for your next party but also plan your party from soup to nuts. SpoonFed brings the party planner to you and me. 

The current version of SpoonFed enables you to browse existing party ideas as well as create new parties. Future features will include product/vendor recommendations and invitation support.

This repository serves as the API for the front end [javascript/react](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) app which can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/ValerieMcCarthy/spoonfed-react).


This project was created as a final project for the full-stack web developer course at the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/).
